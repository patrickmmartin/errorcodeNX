Defining and using a symbol analogue for error reporting in c++
====

Problem statement
====

High quality software requires a well defined and straightforward error handling strategy to allow a system to protect or verify its invariants in the face of invalid input or runtime state. There are many positions taken on how to achieve this see [Google 2015], [Bloomberg 2015] [Mozilla 2015] [Wikipedia 2015]. It seems clear that there is not yet a concensus on the issue.
Nevertheless, error handing is everyone's responsibility and particularly so for applications coded in c++ and C. In this article we will make a proposal, which we'll call `error_id` which can be used an _identity_ concept (concept with a little "c") to ensure when a specific course of action is desired, the error state reported by an API can be unambiguously recognised at arbitrarily remote call sites.

Review of c++ and C approaches
====

A very common style for reporting from functions in C/c++ is using ```enum``` or ```int``` values to enumerate all possible reported statuses and returning these values from library calls. An extension of this approach is to encode a value and some additional category info into an integral value, forming a system of return statuses like HRESULT [Wikipedia 2015]. However these different set of independent ```enum``` and ```int``` return values cause significant issues from the mapping of these independent sets when interfaces must be composed into new interfaces that themselves must define new return statuses. HRESULT-style status values do not have this issue, but a given system must have all possible error return statuses registered, so that they can be reported and handled consistently. This scales poorly to larger software system. Note that in COM/DCOM HRESULTS can be the outcome of IPC calls, thus extending into other universes of HRESULT values.
It is possible to define even more complex error handling schemes, such as registering callbacks or having an explicit error stack. And finally, global or thread-local system library variables for an `errno` style approach are of course available, with the usual basket of caveats.

Fundamentally, the problem when library boundaries are crossed is that without access to a shared _identity_ type whose value describes the status the solutions all tends towards the familiar "a non zero return result indicates an error", which is indeed sensibly enough the position of many error handling schemes employing return codes exclusively. Schemes have been constructed to allow additional information relevant to that status to be extracted, but composing them can be difficult or verbose.
The concern is that a large amount of code becomes devoted to merely mapping values between the return code sets of various libraries, which has a number of critiques on how this will scale:
* claiming to handle the return codes from dependency systems (and transitively via their dependencies) is a forward commitment, which may or not remain valid over time
* the amount of code written / code paths will result in issues
* the most prudent approach is to have a consistent "non-zero return code indicates an error" policy, which has the deficiency of requiring all library clients "opt into" the steps required to obtain more information on a failed operation

error_id type proposal
====

The proposed type for _error_id_ is fundamentally this: `typedef const char * const error_id` which is the _rvalue_ whereas the _lvalue_ is of course `typedef const char * error_value`.

We strongly recommend this value should be printable and make sense in the context of inspecting system state from logs, messages, cores etc. 

Interestingly, a brief search for prior art in this area reveals no prior proposals, though we'd love to hear of any we have overlooked (TODO(PMM) compiler authors ROFL?). The value is of course unique in the process, being a pointer, solving the problem of registration. Note that it is implementation defined whether identical char[] constants could be folded into one pointer [c++ std lex.string para 13]. In fact, barring inspecting the program core at runtime, or having higher order knowledge of the declaration of symbols, this constant folding one of the few ways to obtain the value _a priori_ without having access to the correct symbol in code. Note that so far we have not persuaded any compiler to actually fold two string constants and encounter this issue.

As such, we contend that a constant of this type can be used as an _identity_ concept, whose values can be passed through opaquely from any callee to any caller. Caller and callee can be separated by any number of layers of calls and yet the return values can be passed transparently back to a caller, allowing for the amount of mandatory code to be slashed, resulting in less effort and less opportunity for inappropriate handling. 

To compare with prior art in this area: note that Ruby's symbols [Ruby 2015] and Clojure's keywords [Clojure 2015] supply similar concepts supported at the language level.

### Code sample: defining an _error_id_

```
// elsewhere, declared
error_id foo;
...
// elsewhere, defined
const char foo[] = "My Foo Status";

...

// you can't do this (no existential forgery)

error_id ret = get_an_error();
/*
if (ret == "My Foo Status") // does not compile with -Wall -Werror
                            //"comparison with string literal results in unspecified behaviour" 
{
    ...
}
*/

if (ret)
{
   if (ret == MY_KNOWN_ERROR) // this is how to test
   {
     // for this interesting case, here we might need to do additional work
     // for logging, notification and the life
   }
   mylogger <<  "api_call returned " ret << "/n";
    
}
return ret;  /// we can always do this with no loss of information
```

_error_id_  desirable properties 
====

An _error_id_  has a number of good properties, in addition to being a familiar type to all C/c++ programmers.

* it is a built in type _in C and c++_ - and has the expected semantics: the comparison ```if (error)``` will test for presence of an error condition.
* default use is efficient
* Safe for concurrent access
* usage is exception free 
* Globally registered, the linker handles it [standard section, dynamic loading etc.] [If patching your binary is your thing, then enjoy, but please aware what implications that process has]
* If the content is a printable string constant, (which we strongly recommend) then inherently it supports printing for logging purposes and can be read for debugging.

error_id usage examples - "C style"
====

As a consequence of these good properties, we can see the following styles are available.

### Code Sample: manual error handling (Mozilla style)

```
error_value ret;
 
ret = in();
if (ret)
    return ret;
    
ret = a_galaxy();
if (ret)
    return ret;
    
ret = far_far_away();
if (ret)
    return ret;

ret = awaken_force();
    
if (ret)
{
     // list known continuable errors here
     if ((ret == E_FORD_BROKEN_ANKLE) || (ret == E_FORD_TRANSPORTATION_INCIDENT) &&
         (Ford::scenes::in_the_can()))
     {
        print_local_failure(ret); // whoops!
     }
     else
     {
         panic(ret); // THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT RETURN
     }
}

order_popcorn();
```

### Code Sample: error conditions can be composed dynamically

```
error_value ret;
for (test_step : test_steps)
{
    ret = test_step(args);
    if (ret)
    {
        log << "raised error [" << ret << "] in test step " << test_step;
        return error_id;
    }
    // alternatively we might run all,
    // or more and produce a nicely formatted table for debugging / monitoring
    
}
```
 
Use of _error_id_ with exception based error handling
------------------------------------------------------

So far, all the previous code examples would have worked almost as well if _error_id_ were an integral type, however the identity of an _error_id_ is exploitable to provide good answers to a number of issues that can arise with deciding to use exceptions and also maintains the good properties of exception handling.

Not everyone uses exceptions, and not everyone has used exceptions well; to be fair there has been a history of dubious prior art in this area. All the following are real world examples of code that went to production, or can be found in patent submissions, etc. The names of the guilty parties have been removed while we await the expiry of any relevant statutes.
* ```throw 99```
* ```catch (const char * err)```
* reliance upon `catch (...)```
* reliance upon checking ```what()```
* every exception is std::runtime_error

However, making use of _error_id_ and inheriting from one of the standard exception types such that it has the same identity semantics is useful for the same reasons as for the using the raw value. As an example: exception class templates specialised on _error_id_ are very apt:

### Code Sample: exception template allowing exceptions with _identity_
  
```  
// we can define a simple template parameterised upon the error_id value
template <error_id errtype> class typed_error_lite : public std::exception {};
    
// or we can go a little further and allow for some additional information
// this one has a base type and additional info
template <error_id errtype> class typed_error : public std::exception {
public:
  typed_error(const char *what = NULL) : _what(what) {}

  virtual const char *what() const throw() { return (_what) ? _what : type(); }
  const char *type() const { return errtype; }
  operator const char *() { return errtype; }

private:
  error_id _what;
};
```

### Code Sample: define and handle exceptions concisely based upon an _error_id_

```
    // elsewhere
    FooErrors::EFOO = "FOOlib: Foo error";
    
    ...

    // we can define new unique exception instances
    typedef typed_error<FooErrors::EFOO> foo_err;
    typedef typed_error<FooErrors::EBAR> bar_err;
    
    try
    {
      // something that throws a typed_error
    }
    catch (typed_error<FooErrors::EFOO> &e)
    {
      // use the template
    }
    /* you can't even write this 
    catch (typed_error<"FOOlib: Foo error"> &e)
    {
      // use the template
    }
    */
    catch (bar_err &e)
    {
      // or a typedef
    }
    catch (...)
    {
      // we don't get here
    }
```

This approach has some rather neat properties: we can avoid "false matches" caused by code handling exception types too greedily. The parameter has to be an _error_id_, not a string literal.
Having a unified set of identities allows callees to throw an exception, relying upon callers higher in the stack to make the decision on how to handle that status, and avoiding the need re-throw the exception. Even if re-thrown - if the same _error_id_ is used, the _identity_ is of course preserved even if the stack at the point of re-throw is different from the originating thrower.

### Code Sample: exception handling with fall-through

```
    try
    {
      // something that throws a typed_error<LibA::EPOR>
      // if LibA::EPOR ia not a publically visible value,
      // it is not possible to write a handler for that case only
      // nor throw one, except for the code owning that identity
    }
    catch (typed_error<LibA::EBAR> &e)
    {
      // not caught
    }
    catch (std::runtime_error &e)
    {
      // typed_error<LibA::EPOR> is caught here, conveniently
    } 
```

TODO(PMM) - think about possible template instantiation concerns.

There is one responsibility that is granted along with the benefit of universality: since everyone could receive an error code, there may be a need to approach declaring _error_id_ instances to some corporate standard of consistency. This may well mandate some kind of scheme perhaps based upon library, component, etc. to generate standard formats and ensure unique values.

Code Sample: simple example for generating "standard" _error_id_ value.    
```
#define SCOPE_ERROR(grp, pkg, error_str) grp "-" pkg ": " error_str

// this can be used thus
const char LibA::EPOR[] = SCOPE_ERROR("GRP", "FOO", "Foo not reparable");

// which give us the string  "GRP-FOO: Foo not reparable"

// Organisations can exploit other preprocessor features to ensure uniqueness
#define STRINGIFY(x) #x
#define TOSTRING(x) STRINGIFY(x)

#define SCOPE_ERROR_UNIQUE(grp, pkg, error_str) \
    __FILE__ ":" TOSTRING(__LINE__) " " grp "-" pkg ": " error_str " " __DATE__ " " __TIME__

// which give us a string like ../test_error_id.cpp:39 GRP-FOO: Foo not Bar Oct  4 2015 12:07:30

```

No Existential Forgery of _error_id_
--------------------------------------

So, what do is meant by "existential forgery"? There are two types:
* the first is caused innocently enough by interfacing c++ client code a C style API which defins an enum for the return status type from an interface. This *forces* us to make a mapping some status and another - clearly this is a good place for incorrect logic to creep in, on the basis on the nature of the code. 
* the second is caused by the problems caused by a policy of not documenting return values; integral values cannot be made an implementation detail and in large systems it is all too common for code to handle the return `-99` to appear when clients perceive a need to perform handling for that situation.
This problem is addressed by _error_id_ in two different ways:
 -  possibly most valuably, we can break out of the cycle because the moderate level of self-description in the string of the raw value should faciliate implementing a better approach as trivially the component, file and issue can be delivered
 - additionally, _error_id_ values can be made internal or for public consumption, enforcing a consistent discipline using the language, again the string contents can back this up, but the clear contract supplied by the library can be "please feel free to interpret these error states, but any others must be handled using the "Internal Error" strategy 
 - note also that exposing an _error_id_ is no longer a forward commitment, as prior values can be *removed* in new revisions of the interface, in addition to new ones being introduced. This is of course in constrast to integral values return codes.


### Code Sample: Generation of identities and unique identities
```
const char N::new_bar[] = SCOPE_ERROR("GRP", "FOO", "Foo not Bar");
 
assert(strcmp(N::new_bar, FooErrors::EBAR) == 0);
assert((N::new_bar != FooErrors::EBAR));
 
try
{
  throw typed_error<N::new_bar>("bazong not convertible to bar");
}
catch (typed_error<FooErrors::EBAR> &e)
{
  assert(false, "in typed_error<FooErrors::EBAR> handler");
}
catch (typed_error<N::new_bar> &e)
{
  // ok!
}
catch (...)
{
  assert(false, "Fell through to catch all handler");
}
```

What _error_id_ cannot do
-------------------------

No solution is perfect, and this is no exception, so in the spirit of allowing people to choose for themselves, let us attempt to list some of common concerns one would come up with and address them:

* be cases in ```switch``` statements
    - we do not see this as practically much of an issue as this only applies to code using raw _error_id_, and not exceptions and there are two main use cases:
    1. hand crafting the mapping between incompatible return statuses. For this we suggest it should not be necessary as _error_id_ values would ideally only need to be thrown/returned and consumed 
    2. finally reaching code responsible for handling a set of specific codes differently. In this case, chained ```if/else if``` blocks for integral types should suffice.
    
* return additional info 
  - this is of course a natural consequence of using a pure _error_id_ as an identity
  - exception classes similar to _typed_error_ of course allow as much context as one is prepared to pay for in one object instance, 
  - if status need more context - conditions like "[file|table|foo] not found" being the most infuriating - then we have to leave it to the user to code up a solution to pass back more context

* defence against abuse
  - in a C / c++ application, there is no way to completely prevent abuse such as _error_id_ values being appropriated and used inappropriately; the intent of the proposal is to illustrate the benefits arising from the simplicity and effectiveness of using _error_id_. We hope that the solution would be adopted widely upon its own merits.

* yield stable values between processes / builds
    - firstly, it should be remembered the value is not be inspected - only what it points to 
    - secondly, this is unavoidable and the solution of course stops working at the boundary of the process - marshalling status codes between different processes, binaries and even different aged builds of the same code cannot rely upon the address. This is a job for some marshalling scheme layered on top of an existing status code system.

* The strings cannot be translated 
  - firstly, _error_id_ is a point to a const array of char: dynamic translation into user readable string can only be done by mapping. 
  - additionally it must be remembered they although designed to be useful for diagnostics and debugging, these strings should never be treated as trusted output and displayed to system end users. This is because by design an  _error_id_ can travel as an opaque value, and hence there is no rigorous mechanism preventing the secure design error of rendering inputs of unknown origin directly to an end user. 

Wrap up
=======

In summary, once the perhaps slightly odd feeling of using  _error_id_ fades, we hope it is a technique that people will adopt in composing larger systems when the error handling strategy is being designed. The process wide identity concept allows for composition of large-scale applications comprising many components, while affording the ooportunity of an exception-like error handling with or _without_  employing actual exceptions, and maintaining a high level of debuggability. This approach will allow both C and c++ libraries to become first class citizens in a design where error handling need never be left to chance or assumption.

Recommendations
====

* Define your identities for system states
* Define how you wish to expose these identities and distribute them. For example, component level, subsystem level, applciation wide?
* Use them rigourously

Curate's Eggs
-------------

There are yet some potentially interesting ramifications that fall out from error_id that have not been demonstrated, but which we'll touch upon here to pique your interest.

* _missing switch_: it is possible to write template metaprograms that will
    - allow statically typed handlers to be registered for a switch statement to ensure values are always handled, with various outcomes for a fall-through, (Fail, Pass, etc.)
    - even prevent compilation if handlers are not located for specific  _error_id_ instances 
* _private values_: it is possible to define an _error_id_   _typed_error_  with a value not visible to clients 
   - for _typed error_ this would allows a standard abort via exception for reporting those error conditions not understood explicitly by callers
   - for _error id_ this can allow a hierarchy of error conditions to be defined
* _reserved values_: it is possible to expose an _error_id_ such that it can not be used to define a _typed_error_, yet the value can still be used
