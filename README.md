# errorcodeNX

Overview
========

This repo houses an article and the code supporting the idea of 
maintaining a registered set of unique error conditions.

There is an Eclipse project file and (maybe one day) a proper X-platform build.

Code
====

Everything you need to get started is in [error_id.hpp](./error_id.hpp)

The salient code is a set of CATCH test suites.

Architectures
=============

Tested on xlC, SunCC, clang, gcc so far

Article
=======

The article is kept in [article.md](./article.md)
